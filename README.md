## Overview 
This project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete using various machine learning techniques. Concrete compressive strength is a critical factor in construction and infrastructure, 
determining the load-bearing capacity of concrete structures. Accurate predictions help in optimizing the mix design and ensuring safety and durability.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 1,030 instances with 8 features related to the concrete mix and one target variable, which is the compressive strength. The features include:

##### Cement (kg in a cubic meter)
##### Blast Furnace Slag (kg in a cubic meter)
##### Fly Ash (kg in a cubic meter)
##### Water (kg in a cubic meter)
##### Superplasticizer (kg in a cubic meter)
##### Coarse Aggregate (kg in a cubic meter)
##### Fine Aggregate (kg in a cubic meter)
